## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

dopeShop is the Web3 alternative of the famous local marketplace <a href="https://olx.com/">OLX</a>. It is basically a very basic eCommerce platform that gives any user to buy and sell products using a Web3 enabled browser and a wallet. There is a plethora of scope for improvement and features to be added.


### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

Following technologies and libraries are used for the development of this project.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai](https://chaijs.com/)
- [Infura](https://infura.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üìå Getting Started

To setup the project locally follow the steps below

### üíª Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
- [Metamask Wallet Extension](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or a Web3 browser like Brave

### ü§ñ Running the project.

To set this up in the local repository:

1. **Fork** and **clone** the project to your local system
2. Copy the commands below to install the dependencies:

```
npm i -g truffle
npm run client:install
npm run truffle:install
```

3. Now, start a local Ethereum blockchain network on your system using Ganache. Ganache provides you with 10 testing accounts each with 100 ETH. 

4. Obtain Infura API Key and API Secret for IPFS from [Infura Dashboard](https://infura.io/), and create a dedicated gateway for your project. Set the environment variables in `client/.env` file.

5. Then, copy the following commands to deploy the smart contracts to the local Ethereum blockchain and start the React app:

```
npm run truffle:migrate
npm run client:start
```

6. Set up Metamask to connect to the local blockchain created by Ganache(i.e. [http://localhost:7545/](http://localhost:7545/))

7. Now, obtain the private keys of some of the accounts from Ganache and import the accounts into Metamask wallet.

8. You're ready to go. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check out dopeShop

# React Truffle Box

This box comes with everything you need to start using Truffle to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them from a React app.

## Installation

First ensure you are in an empty directory.

Run the `unbox` command using 1 of 2 ways.

```sh
# Install Truffle globally and run `truffle unbox`
$ npm install -g truffle
$ truffle unbox react
```

```sh
# Alternatively, run `truffle unbox` via npx
$ npx truffle unbox react
```

Start the react dev server.

```sh
$ cd client
$ npm start
  Starting the development server...
```

From there, follow the instructions on the hosted React app. It will walk you through using Truffle and Ganache to deploy the `SimpleStorage` contract, making calls to it, and sending transactions to change the contract's state.

## FAQ

- __How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?__

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.

- __Where can I find more resources?__

  This Box is a sweet combo of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). Either one would be a great place to start! -->
